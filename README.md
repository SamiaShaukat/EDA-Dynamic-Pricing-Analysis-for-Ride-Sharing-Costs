# EDA-Dynamic-Pricing-Analysis-for-Ride-Sharing-Costs

## Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing a dataset related to ride-sharing service costs to understand the various factors that influence ride pricing. By conducting an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), the project aims to uncover patterns and correlations among features such as ride duration, location, vehicle type, and booking time.

## Key Insights

### Numerical Features:
- Ride Duration: Strongly correlates with ride cost, showing that longer rides are more expensive.
- Driver Availability: Moderately impacts cost; fewer drivers during high demand can increase prices.
- Number of Riders, Average Ratings, Past Rides: Show weak or no significant impact on cost, indicating these factors have minimal influence on pricing.

### Categorical Features:
- Location Category: Significant effect on ride cost, with urban areas typically incurring higher costs due to increased traffic and demand.
- Vehicle Type: Premium vehicles generally cost more than economy options, influencing pricing.
- Time of Booking: Peak times (e.g., rush hours, weekends) result in higher costs due to surge pricing driven by demand and limited driver availability.
- Customer Loyalty Status: Loyalty tiers like Silver may lead to different pricing structures, potentially offering discounts.

## Conclusion

The analysis highlights that key factors such as ride duration, location, vehicle type, and booking time are crucial for predicting ride costs. These insights will guide the development of more accurate pricing models. Factors like driver availability and customer loyalty also contribute significantly, while the number of riders, ratings, and past rides have minimal effects on cost.
